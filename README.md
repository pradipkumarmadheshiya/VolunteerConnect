# VolunteerConnect
### Django_DRF_Project

VolunteerConnect is a platform designed to connect volunteers with opportunities to serve their communities, inspired by VolunteerMatch and Idealist. It facilitates the coordination and management of volunteer activities, enabling organizations to post opportunities and volunteers to find and sign up for roles that match their interests and skills.
